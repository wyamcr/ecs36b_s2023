INTRO:
    This is a program that will generate a JSON file that contains records of the differences in people, things, GPS, and time. 
    The base files were created and written by Felix Wu and were modified by Jack Kooba and Wyatt McRoberts into their current iteration

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
    Type "make" into a terminal while inside the hw3 directory. Then type "./main" and the program will run.

THINGS TO NOTE:
    The current version of the program will run on a MACOS device. If the user is using WSL UBUNTU then they will need to adjust the include path for the JSON headers (ex. #include <json/json.h> will need to become <jsconcpp/json/json.h>)
